1. Order comes in and a SO is created by PM, Fulfillment Lead, or Shopify
2. If the SO is created by the PM, PM notifies LM if bulk work is needed.  
3. LM prepares a ticket for work with the following data:
	1. SO number
	2. batch record
	3. Inflow MO link
	4. points for complexity/time
	5. batch code(s) and potential subitems
		1. show Helios example on [Monday](https://earthharbor.monday.com/boards/8448285579/pulses/8552544003) and [Inflow](https://app.inflowinventory.com/manufacturing-orders/2c448bdb-bb24-47c0-84ee-2e3a6a0cbdfb)
		2. Talk about if this is an issue moving forward
4. lab tech completes the work 
	1. uploads or links batch record before moving to QA column 
	2. labels three samples with the batch code -- stability, retention, and QA
5. QA and Tech Lead - overseeing processes, quality, and documentation
	1. Lab Tech Lead creates a COA with QA sample, and then ships to CTLA
	2. QA uses COA during production and returns paperwork to Tech Lead for records
6. Lab Tech Lead closes the bulk ticket and notifies PM
7. PM moves SO forward, coordinating with production line and fulfillment, until finally marking Inflow SO as fulfilled.  
8. Every sprint we review and consider SO stats with Monday workflow stats
