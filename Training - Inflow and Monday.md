[[Inflow Scenarios - soon to come]]

Quickly touch on [[Critical Workflow Questions]], simply see team responses.  

Transition question: When do we make a Sales Order?  
# Inflow & Sales Orders

[[What is a Sales Order?]]

When is a Sales Order created? 
- Sales team
- automatically by Shopify (right now should be manual by fulfillment)
- when PM recieves a PO

Should we ever fulfill something that is not recorded in an SO?  

Takeouts
- [[slack idea for SOs]]
- [[Monday boards and statuses]]

# Inflow & Product Orders
Sales Orders (SOs) are what goes out and how that affects inventory. 
Product Orders (POs) are what comes in and how that affects inventory.  

Group Discussion:
- When do we initialize a Product Order?  
- Where in Inflow do we make that happen?  
- Who is responsible to initialize a Product Order? 

Show a report from Inflow of all products at a reorder point - why haven't we reordered?  

Show current MOs - show the various parts, and talk about who owns these parts and next steps forward 
- MO ingredient statuses
	- Low stock
	- blocked
- the order form from “low stock” status 
	- If vendors are set, this works better than ingredient-orders, true or false? 
	- How quickly could this get messy?  Like what if two people both create the POs 
- if we don’t approach it this way, then how should we be approaching it?  
	- Ideal
- How do we move forward from we are? 
	- Why aren’t we doing this yet? 

## Parking Lot

Batch records and MO - why would we have an MO that is outside the size of an approved batch size? 
- Open for discussion - An MO for bulk product should be
	- a batch code size 
	- some other size
