## Moving Toward AI Agents, Managerial Oversight, and Human Value

Paul, Shane —

We're moving toward a future where structured data, automation, and AI agents run entire workflows under the supervision of managers. Human energy will be focused where it matters most: solving new problems, making creative decisions, and generating direct value in areas not yet automated.

## The Problem

Right now, our system works — Monday, Google Sheets, and Drive are functional and familiar. But we're operating at the lowest levels of maturity when it comes to:

* **Data security and permissions**
* **Access control**
* **Ownership of internal data**
* **Scalability and automation potential**

We’re now in a place where our current processes can meet revenue milestones — but from a data perspective, we remain fragmented and hard to manage programmatically. We are not scalable in terms of data infrastructure, and there's a clear limiter to growth that will become pressing soon after our first revenue milestones are hit. This is why I want to put on the radar the idea of building a dev team to support this — specifically, hiring my close friend Jake, a trusted, efficient frontend and Azure CosmosDB developer, to help us gain control of our internal data as a strategic asset.

## Where This Goes

Once we start consistently hitting revenue milestones and have clean, reliable reports:

* We'll revisit this shift: using **JSON as our internal source of truth**, powering automation, AI, and internal logic.
* Monday will continue as the **work interface**, where humans interact with and manage processes — and where AI agent activity is manifested, monitored, and supervised by managers.
* As we mature, we can build out **internal software**, and eventually house our data in **Microsoft CosmosDB** for performance, structure, and long-term control.

This is just Lesson 1 — outlining the trajectory. For now, let’s focus on execution and clarity. The infrastructure comes next.

### Final Thought for Later Discussion

As we scale, our organizational structure needs to reflect the reality of attrition dynamics. Teams should ideally remain between 5–8 people. Once we reach that threshold, we must carefully evaluate how we scale — whether vertically (by adding managerial layers) or horizontally (by duplicating team structures under parallel managers).

My thesis is that vertical scaling, while sometimes necessary, often introduces avoidable inefficiencies — such as communication loss, cultural dilution, and structural complexity. These downsides can frequently be mitigated with thoughtful application of AI.

If we continue to build a **value-stream-based culture** — where work is visible, accountable, and augmented by AI — then AI agents can extend the effective capacity of each manager and team. This allows us to scale **without defaulting to vertical structures**, preserving team autonomy, clarity, and cohesion.

This thinking applies even to line worker teams. Culture is shaped from the bottom up as much as from the top down. Smaller, well-supported teams — managed by leaders who act as internal recruiters and diplomats for capacity and value — will be more efficient and aligned with the 80/20 principle.

If we nurture this culture intentionally, the good karma we invest into our operations and relationships will compound into long-term success. This principle of mutual contribution and shared growth is foundational to everything we’re building — and, with the supplement of AI and well-defined management processes, it can preserve a healthy company culture with novel efficiency as we grow.
