# Value Stream Mapping Course + Early Takeaways

Hey Paul,

I wanted to share this YouTube playlist Iâ€™ve been studying â€” itâ€™s a full course on **Value Stream Mapping (VSM)**, which I believe will eventually become foundational to how we structure operations across the company:

My plan is to work through the course slowly and deliberately, but Iâ€™ve intentionally paused at the 3:15 mark of the first video for now. The reason: we donâ€™t yet have fully working department flows in Monday, and I believe the VSM should **co-arise with working systems**, not strictly emerge from them. Thereâ€™s a productive tension between moving fast and thinking slow â€” between sales urgency and process clarity â€” and that tension is what creates resilient systems that serve the whole business.

It was insightful yesterday when you stopped us from overdiagramming too soon. I think we are doing good at tightly coupling our executive actions and systems architecture in the yin and yang tension that pushes us to have good systems even as we are moving fast to get things done now.

### Key Takeaways
- A value stream is everything from sales to fulfillment â€” every step needed to deliver value.
- Organizational structure should come *after* the value stream is understood, not before.
- Responsibilities should never be assigned based on preference â€” only based on what the value stream demands. Otherwise, we risk creating bad culture and misaligned teams.

In fact, you could say a business is composed of two essential forces: **sales/marketing** and **process/fulfillment** â€” and the value stream is the connective tissue that makes them function as one system.

For now, Iâ€™m keeping this at a napkin level â€” just sketching flows and mapping out what happens day-to-day. Once Monday is fully rolled out and under pressure, we can start aligning roles and optimization efforts to a clearer value stream map.

More soon â€” just wanted you in the loop.
