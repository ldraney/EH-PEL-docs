Hey Shane,

We are ready to implement the following, and I want your support.  
My ask here is this: please start trusting your leaders and managers to coordinate work based on your needs.  

This is in light of the recent Obscura, Blankenship, and Beauty Heroes work that you are directing. 
- Obscura - from my knowledge, this work was handled by you rather than your production manager. 
- Blankenship - this is a good example of  

I want to propose a clarified team philosophy with you, so we can align how we handle chaos, define priorities, and protect our value streams as we grow.  

**Why We Avoid Technical Debt**

* Lack of accountability structure and word of mouth leaves managers isolated and encourages employees to act as decision-makers instead of focused executioners
* Creates hidden work that drains focus and distracts from key value streams
* Increases team attrition due to firefighting, unclear goals, and lack of data-driven incentive structures.  

**Team Philosophy:**

1. **If it’s not on Monday, it’s not a priority** — Work lives on the board, or it doesn’t get done.
2. **Wait until tomorrow** — If it wasn’t asked by 9:00 AM today, it goes on tomorrow’s board for triage. This keeps us stable and prevents chaos.
3. **Scoped work is accountable** — Whoever takes it on has declared to the team that they understand it. This is why daily meetings matter — accountability.Clean structure, clear ownership, easy to hand off.
4. **This is why we have standup** — Daily updates keep the team moving without helicopter parenting.

**Your Role as a Value Creator:**
You bring in the opportunity — sales, relationships, high-level goals. Your value is in what you **need**, not in directing how it gets done. When you tell us what you want — Paul, Jen, and I will scope it, assign it, prioritize it, and execute it.&#x20;

If it’s not defined clearly, we’ll help extract the acceptance criteria. Once it’s scoped, it goes on the right board, and we run it through the system.  The key here is: you are scoping work with managers, not their team members.  

To keep things efficient, direct chaos (questions, ideas, problems) to us — not to individual employees. We’ll translate it into structured work and make sure it’s executed. That’s how we scale without confusion.  

This isn’t about control — it’s about protecting your bandwidth and delivering faster.
